Arduino Temperature Measurment and Control

This project seeks to develop Arduino applications and libraries to enable mechanical engineering students at
Missouri University of Science and Technology to use Arduino hardware to perform common experimental data acquisition and control functions.   The Arduino application, ATMC, measures six temperatures, while controlling one, using the MAX31856 SPI thermocouple interface chip.
